## 2026-11-13 · SHOWHAUS walk: viewer, upgrade card, claim (Quick, 12 personas × 2 models)

Stimulus: screenshots of /walk/, /walk/?p=buildtec-avalon (base walk, AI walk clip, upgrade card) and the claim page. Personas: `personas-showhaus-walk.json`. Responses: `r1.txt` (card v1), `r2.txt` (card v2, 6 personas, one model). Scoring: `ssr.py`.

Predictions to check against PostHog / D1 events (`walk_open`, `walk_room`, `upgrade_open`, `upgrade_interest`, `claim_started`, `claim_submitted`):

1. Home seekers use the base walk for layout but do not pay for a photoreal walk of an unclaimed home. Predicted weakest step: paying before the home is claimed.
2. After the card change ("Vote for this home — free", no "credits"), the share of card openers who tap the vote rises. Panel: 0 of 6 said they would tap before, 4 of 6 after (1 more "might").
3. Of builder-side visitors, small custom builders and marketing staff claim; a volume builder's sales manager does not and refers it to legal.
4. Ranking of who would pay once a price exists: small custom builder > builder marketing > home seeker with own plan > home seeker browsing a catalogue design > renter.

Not yet checked. SSR note: with `bge-small-en-v1.5` the distributions bunch around the middle and did not separate clear refusals from clear yeses, so the counts above come from the stated actions in the text, not from SSR means.
